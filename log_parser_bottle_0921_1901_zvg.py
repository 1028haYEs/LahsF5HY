# log_parser_bottle.py
#
# This is a Python program that utilizes the Bottle framework to create a
# log file parsing tool. It allows users to upload a log file and parse it.
#
# Requirements:
#   - Python 3.x
#   - Bottle framework
#
# Usage:
#   Run this script with a Python interpreter and access the provided URL
#   to upload and parse log files.
#
